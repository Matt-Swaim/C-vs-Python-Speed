# CPP vs. Python Speed Comparison
This program sorts through a list of integers ("numbers.txt") and bubble sorts them twice: one using C++ and one using Python, and then records those times in a seperate file and produces an graph that shows the comparison of those times. This project gives a direct showing of how C++ is faster than Python when it comes to bubble sorting as more and more numbers are sorted. Obviously, the two languages used in this project are C++ and Python.
