# CPP vs. Python Speed Comparison
This program sorts through a list of 10000 integers ("numbers.txt"), starting at 1000 of those integers and going up in increments of 1000 and uses bubble sort to sort each set of integers twice: once using C++ and once using Python, and then records how long each sort took and produces an graph that shows the comparison of those times. This project allows the user to directly see how C++ is faster than Python when it comes to bubble sorting as more and more numbers are sorted. Obviously, the two languages used in this project are C++ and Python.
Starter code (numbers.txt and many parts of BubbleSort.py and BubbleSort.cpp) provided by Lisa Dion
