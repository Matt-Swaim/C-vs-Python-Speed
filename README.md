# CPP vs. Python Speed Comparison
This program sorts through a list of integers ("numbers.txt") and bubble sorts them twice: one using C++ and one using Python, and then records those times in a seperate file and produces an graph that shows the comparison of those times. In order to run the program, both Python and C++ must be installed. 
Starter code provided by Lisa Dion and finished by me
